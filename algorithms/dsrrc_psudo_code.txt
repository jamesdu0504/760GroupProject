INPUT: source database D, Minimum Confidence Threshold MCT, Minimum Support Threshold
OUTPUT: sanitized database D'

1. generate association rules
2. SR = a selected set of rules with singleton antecedent and consequent i.e. x->y
3. generate clusters (a cluster contains all rules in SR with the same consequent)
4. calculate item sensitivity within each cluster
5. calculate rule sensitivity within each cluster
6. calculate the sensitivity of each cluster

7. for each cluster find the sensitive transactions of that cluster
8. sort clusters in decreasing order of sensitivity  
9. sort transactions associated with the first cluster of (8) in decreasing order of sensitivity 
10. for each cluster c
11.     while an element of SR is not hidden
12.         let t be the first transaction for cluster c
13.         delete the common R.H.S of the transaction
14.         if the deleted item was in the tranaction lists of other items 
15.             deacrese transaction sensitivity 
16.             sort the transactions
17.         for rule in SR:
18.             update support and confidence of the rule
19.             if support(rule)<MST or confidence(rule)<MCT:
20.                 remove rule from SR
21.         let t be the next tranaction
